# Require Platform Transitions
## This works by setting the targte platform to an invalid platform
## and each `x_binary()` and `x_library()` rule unfortunately needs
## to tag itself with `platform_missing` to get excluded from glob
## builds like `build //...` but still have a way to include them
## by removing the filter line for things like Rust Analyzer.
